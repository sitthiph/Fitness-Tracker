# Fitness Tracker
Fitness Tracker currently in its development phase and is currently not working. It is not yet deployed.

## Overview
Are you tired of not finding a simple and suitable workout tracker that is not a spreadsheet? Look no further than this Fitness Tracker. 

## Motivation
I started this project because I was tired of tracking my workout in complicated spreadsheets or even on some mobile apps which is either too restricted or just plain complicated. I wanted a nice GUI interface to track my workouts and goals in but not to overload them with extra features. Just a simple plug-and-display.

## How it was built
I've built this project using MongoDB, Express, NodeJS, and GraphQL. Due to the nature of how this is being set up, MongoDB and its NoSQL are perfect. We've also implemented GraphQL instead of RESTful due to the perfect combination in keeping HTTP request packages small, resulting in a more fluent and faster front-end response.

## What's next for Fitness Tracker
In the future, I want to be able to have the options to export them onto a spreadsheet. The main goal of this is for sharing purposes and readability of others who do not use the app
